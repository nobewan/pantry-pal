## **Project name: Pantry Pal**

## **WHY WE MADE IT**
We wanted to find how to detect food spoilage using a gas sensor in real time so you'll know what food has gone bad before you even open the door.

## **HOW WE MADE IT**

# **Website**: 
- Frontend: ReactJS and TailwindCSS to display our data that it fetches from the backend to make our dashboard
- Backend: Node.js + Express fetches data that we stored using Snowsight (Snowflake Web Interface)
# **Hardware**:
- Gas sensor:
- LCD Display:
- Raspberry Pi 4:
- Arduino:
- Camera:

## **HOW CAN YOU USE IT**

run: 

1. **Run node.js**:
   - cd backend
   - node server.js
2. **Run frontend**
   - cd frontend
   - npm run dev
